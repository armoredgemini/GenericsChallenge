      Collections.sort(teams, new Comparator<Team>() {
        @Override public int compare(Team t1, Team t2) {
            return t1.totalWins - t2.totalWins; // Ascending

    each league can only have same type of teams
    public class League<T extends Team> implements Comparable<Team<T>>
    comparable will use a custom compareTo
